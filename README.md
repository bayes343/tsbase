# TypeScript Generic List

This is an implementation of "part" of the C# List class using TyepScript, and essentially a theoretical exercise using generics in TypeScript.

I wouldn't recommend using this on production sites, since it essentially is just a wrapper for the JavaScript Array type. 

*This is a theoretical activity I've decided to publish.

## Test
- run cmd: `npm install` - installs deps. for testing
- run cmd: `npm run test` / `karma start`
